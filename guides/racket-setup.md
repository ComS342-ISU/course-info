## Programming environment
In this class we use the Racket programming language. The recommended development environment is DrRacket which can be downloaded from here: http://racket-lang.org/download/  

It works on all platforms and it is easy to use.

## The Language
We provide explanations for the core libraries and functionalities of the language, but we expect that you do try and learn more aspects of the language by yourself. A good start is the reference manual: http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/  

Unless otherwise stated you may use any standard library functions that you discover and learn on your own.
